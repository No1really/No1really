I engineer **sound, systems, and experiences**—on Linux, in code, and for real people.  
I believe in the **raw power of simplicity** and the **craft of curation**.

## 🔮 What I Do

- **Live in the terminal** (Arch Linux, daily driver)
- **Produce & sculpt sound** (Raw, cinematic, and experimental)
- **Curate digital environments** (Scripts, automation, minimal GUIs)
- **Connect products to people** (Marketing + psychology)
- **Explore open source** (Contribute, learn, and remix)
- **Pursue perfection** (Every pixel, every parameter, every note)

## 🚀 My Projects

- **[Kō’s Soundpack](https://github.com/No1really/Custom-Easyeffects-Presets):** Audiophile Linux audio presets for EasyEffects—flat, spatial, and bass-heavy. No fluff, just craft.
- **OneClick for GNOME:** Shell scripts make every day a little smoother—automated, minimal, and reliable.
- **More to come**—open source, sound tools, and markdown magic.

## 🎯 Mission

- **I shape sound.**  
- **I optimize systems.**  
- **I make technology feel personal.**

I believe great experiences come not from feature overload, but from careful restraint—from software that works as quietly and reliably as your own heartbeat. My work lives where engineering meets artistry: every preset, every script, every interface is tuned by hand, never by trend.

**I want everything I touch to be functional, elegant, and unmistakably human.**  
Because real minimalism isn’t about less—it’s about the right things doing exactly what they should, without interference.


## 🧶 Interests

- **Customization:** Every system, every sound—tuned to my hand.
- **Automation:** Scripts that make life quieter, not louder.
- **Open Source:** Tools and communities that empower.
- **Minimalism:** Less noise, more signal.
- **Perfectionism:** The detail in detail.

## ☕ Connect

- **GitHub:** [No1really](https://github.com/No1really)
- **Let’s sync**—open to collaboration, sound, and code.
